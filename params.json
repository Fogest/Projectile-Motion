{"name":"Projectile-motion","tagline":"","body":"# Physics Project on Projectile Motion - By Justin Visser\r\n\r\nProjectile motion consists of an components. Some of the components that can be applied to pojectile motion are:\r\n* Kinematic's to determine the vertical and horizontal components of the motion of projectile\r\n* Newton's Laws - Projectile should continue in a straight line in the direction it is fired from, but due to some factors this is not true. Mainly a projectile is affected by gravity, thus causing an arc shape (as examples below will show)\r\n* Gravitational and Kinetic energies change as the projectile moves through the air. We can analyze what these energies could be at certain points\r\n\r\nUtilizing Java I was able to create a mock projectile simulation (see lower in document for code samples)\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/Fogest/Projectile-Motion/raw/master/javatest/run.jnlp](Click to download demo file!)\r\n\r\n## Image Explanation\r\n\r\n![Initial Image](https://raw.github.com/Fogest/Projectile-Motion/master/images/Initial%20example-sketch%20and%20fbd.png)","google":"UA-28142238-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
